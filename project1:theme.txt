1. Group Name: Landlord Ratings
2. Members: Marci McBride, Johnathan Smith, and Iseah Olguin
3. Project Name: Socorro Landlord Ratings
4. Background:
Socorro is a small community with a high demand for rentals close to campus, and often landlords view this as the perfect opportunity to rent their homes without ever keeping up with maintenance.

The goal of our group project is to help other techies be informed about their landlord prior to signing their lease. The web page will contain a map of Socorro, will allow its users to put in a pin on the location of their rental and then rate their landlord. If time allows we will add features such as Google maps and email verification.
