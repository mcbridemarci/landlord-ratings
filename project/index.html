			  <h2 class="subtitle"><span>About</span></h2>
				<p>Socorro is a small community with a high demand for property rentals among NMT students, especially those that are near campus. Often landlords view this as the perfect opportunity to rent their homes, sadly without keeping up with basic home maintenance.</p>
				<p>The goal of our group project is to help other techies be informed about their soon-to-be landlord prior to signing their lease. The webpage will contain a map of Socorro that will allow its users to place a pin on the location of their property rental. It will then allow the user to rate their landlord by completing a form made from a set template, so each user can maintain a sense of comfort and familiarity. Furthermore, depending upon time, we will add features such as Google Maps integration and verification of email addresses from the domain student.nmt.edu. With these extended features -- the website will become more dynamic and enhance our users' overall experience. </p>
