			<h2><span>About</span></h2>
			<p>
				Socorro is a small community with a high demand for property rentals among us New Mexico Tech students, especially those that are near campus. Often landlords view this as the perfect opportunity to rent their homes, sadly without keeping up with basic home maintenance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal of this website is to help other techies be informed about their soon-to-be landlord and rental property prior to signing their lease. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So please help by leaving a review about your current home! This will help all other students know what to expect.
			</p>
			<p>
				Click on the pins on the map bellow to look at the reviews left by other techies for their property rental. 
				Or Click on "Create A New Review" to help out and review your place. 
			</p>
			<h2><span>Please Note</span></h2>
			<p>
				In order to leave a review, you must have a New Mexico Tech email.
